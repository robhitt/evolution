## Evolution the Game

#### About Evolution

This is a 2 player alternating board game.  The objective is to land on the squares with the mushrooms. Once you obtain a mushroom you level up to the character in the evolution cycle.  You'll grow in the evolution cycle in this order:
1. Egg

3. Dinosaur
4. Immortal

Once you become immortal you've won! :tada:
